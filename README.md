# Titanic-Disaster-Survival-ML
The notebook walks you through the steps of predicting if a passenger would have survived the Titanic crash based on the features provided on each passenger.

<h2>Question Definition</h2>
<p>The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.&nbsp; On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.</p>
<p>Here we do the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.</p>

<h2>Getting the training and testing Data</h2>
<p>You can get the training and testing data from : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data</p>
<h2>Visualising the data</h2>
<p>Visualization of data gives us an overview about the features that will affect the prediction most. We use different kinds of graph plots for getting the idea.</p>
<h2>Clearing and preparing the Data</h2>
<p>Here we deal with Missing Data, Categorical Data, remove unwanted features and create new features using Feature Engineering.</p>
<h2>Selecting the correct model for the prediction</h2>
<p>Since this is case of Binary classification (a passenger will either survive or not) we will use below models:</p>
<ol>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors</li>
<li>Support Vector Machines</li>
<li>Naive Bayes classifier</li>
<li>Decision Tree</li>
<li>Random Forrest</li>
</ol>
<h2>Making the Final Prediction</h2>
<p>Depending on the results we choose the best mode for making our final prediction</p>
